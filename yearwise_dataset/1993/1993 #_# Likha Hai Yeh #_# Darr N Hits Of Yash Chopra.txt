yuun hi zara tu muskaraa
you smiled just like this

sharmaake aanchal munh mein dabaa
bashful you pressed your sari hem to your mouth

zulfon ka tu ghuunghat hataa
you tossed the veil of your hair

yeh khuubsuurat chehara dikhaa
you showed me this beautiful face

is naaz se ithalaate huye chalke zaraa mere paas aa
come just a little closer to me slinking flirtatiously

sar rakh diyaa tere paanv paao mein
placed my head at your feet
