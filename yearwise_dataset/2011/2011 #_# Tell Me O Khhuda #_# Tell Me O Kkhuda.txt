 naa kabhi tere school aaya tha
naa kabhi ghar hi kuchh sikhaya tha
naa kabhi khela
naa hi kabhi kaandhe pe leke ghooma tha

what can i say now sorry its my bad
tere kadam dagmagaye ho
aankhon mein aansoon bhar ke aaye ho
kabhi pukara tune
lekin main na aa paaya
what can i say now sorry its my bad

you are my sky and you are my soul naa
you can never do nothing wrong naa
jaane tum kahaan ho
aa jao jahaan ho
you are my sky and you are my soul naa
you can never do nothing wrong naa
jaane tum kahan ho
aa jao jahan ho
love you dad
love you dad
love you dad
love you dad
love you dad
tu meri zindagi tu haqiqat hai
tu hi khwaab
sach main kahoon toh mera hai
oh hai nahi gar yaqeen
dekh le tu ragon mein
jo rawaa hai lahoo toh mera hai
tere bina mein jeena na paaunga
tere bina mein mar hi jaaunga
ho gaya kaise faastere mere darmeyaan

what can i say now sorry its my bad
tere kadam dagmagaye ho
aankhon mein aansoon bhar ke aaye ho
kabhi pukara tune
lekin main na aa paaya
what can i say now sorry its my bad

you are my sky and you are my soul naa
you can never do nothing wrong naa
jaane tum kahaan ho
aa jao jahaan ho
you are my sky and you are my soul naa
you can never do nothing wrong naa
jaane tum kahan ho
aa jao jahan ho
love you dad
love you dad
love you dad
love you dad
love you dad
