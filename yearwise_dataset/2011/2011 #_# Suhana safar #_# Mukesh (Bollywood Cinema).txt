 suhana safar aur yeh mausam haseen
humein darr hai hum kho na jaaye kahin
suhana safar
yeh kaun hansta hai phoolon mein chhupkar
bahar bechain hai jiski dhun par
kahin gungun kahin runjhun
ki jaise nache zameen
suhana safar
yeh gori nadiyon ka chalna uchhalkar
ki jaise allhad chale pi se milkar
pyare pyare yeh nazare nisar hai har kahin
suhana safar
woh aasman jhuk raha hai zameen par
yeh milan humne dekha yahin par
meri duniya mere sapne milenge shaayad yahin
suhana safar
a wonderful journey and beautfiul weather
i am afraid that i might get lost

who is that laughing hiding in the flowers
whose tune is making the spring resetless
humming somewhere tinkling somewhere
as if the earth itself is dancing

this rushing river flows so excitedly
like a young girl returning after meeting her lover
these lovely sceneries are blossoming everywhere

there the sky is touching the earth
here i have witnessed this wonderful meeting
my world my dreams will probably meet me here
