aankhen meri sapne tere
in my eyes are your dreams
dil mera yaadein teri
in my heart are your memories

o mera hai kya
oh what is there of mine

la

sab kuch tera
everything is yours

la

jaan teri saansein teri
my life is yours my breath is yours

meri aankhon mein aansu tere aa gaye
in my eyes came your tears
muskuraane lage saare gham
and my sadness began to smile

this heart doesnt find any interest anymore
kya kahoon main kya karoon
what should i say what should i do

haan tu saamne
yes in front of me

la

baithi rahe
you stay seated

la

main tujhe dekha karoon
i will keep on looking at you

tune aawaaz di dekh main aa gayi
you called out for me and look i came
pyaar se hai badi kya kasam
what vow is bigger than love

on seeing you ive learned this sweetheart
pyaar hota hai deewana sanam
that love is crazy sweetheart

tujhe dekha to yeh jaana sanam
on seeing you ive learned this sweetheart

that love is crazy sweetheart

ab yahan se kahan jaaye hum
now where would i go from here
teri baahon mein mar jaaye hum
i will die in your arms

teri baahon mein mar jaaye hum
i will die in your arms
