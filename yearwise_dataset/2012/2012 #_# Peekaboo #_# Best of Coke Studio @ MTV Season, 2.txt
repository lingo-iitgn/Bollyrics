remember the time when we first met
the very time that u tried to forget
tell me my dear did u miss me at all
did u reach out to touch me did u try to call
did you reach out to touch me yeaahhh

peekaboo i found u again
hiding in the corner with your imaginary friend
and im here tonight to see this through till the end
coz i will always be with 
india  waitin for my sisters to come home
cuz my motherland is feelin oh so alone
kismat say milkay asmaan meraa zameen
jo hogayaa so hogayaa usi gabroo shakeen
a new day is here time to formulate the team
slumgods never is the focus getting cream
more like setting up the scene for a dream to come true
im lost between  languages ancient and new

im a servant of truth but a master of lies
iiving in this world with perfect disguise
im moving away that u wont recognize
when u look in the mirror youll see through my eyes
see through my eyes
see through my 
peekaboo i found u again
hiding in the corner with your imaginary friend
and im here tonight to see this through till the end
tonight to see this through till the end
cuz i will always be  and i will always be  and im here and i will always be with you
