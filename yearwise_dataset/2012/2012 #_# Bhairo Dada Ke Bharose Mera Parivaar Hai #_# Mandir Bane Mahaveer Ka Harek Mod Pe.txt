 aankhon ke panno peon the pages of my eyes
maine likha tha sau dafai had written this a hundred times
lafzon mein jo ishq thathe love that was written by me in words
hua na hothon se bayaancouldnt be conveyed by my lips
khud se naraaz hoonim upset with myself
kyun beaawaaz hoonwhy am i voiceless
meri khamoshiyaan hain sazathese silences are my punishment
dil hai yeh sochtamy heart believes this
phir bhi nahi patabut i still dont know
kis haq se kahun batawith what authority i should tell you
ke tu hain hero merathat youre my hero
lyrics written by sandip roy
teri wajah se hai milionly because of you ive gotten
jeene ki sab khwahisheinthe desirewill to live
paa loon tere dil mein jagahi want to find a place in your heart
hai yeh meri koshishein im making efforts for this
main bas tera banooni want to be only yours
bin tere na rahooni dont want to live without you
maine toh maangi hai yeh dua this is what i have prayed for
dil hai yeh sochtamy heart believes this
phir bhi nahi patabut i still dont know
kis haq se kahun batawith what authority i should tell you
ke tu hain hero mera that youre my hero
