 chali re  chali re  junun ko liye
kataraakataraa lamhon ko piye
pinjre se uda dil kaa shikara
khud hi se maine ishq kiya re

jiya  jiya re  jiya re
jiya  jiya re  jiya re
jiya  jiya re  jiya re
    

jiya re  jiya re
jiya  jiya re  jiya re
jiya  jiya re  jiya re
    

chali re  chali re  junun ko liye
pinjre se uda dil kaa shikara
khud hi se maine ishq kiya re

jiya  jiya re  jiya re

make the way for akira  pump it up
move aside  she s here  yeah  get up
everybody wanna be her  wanna see her
she s akira

chotechote lamhon ko titali jaise pakado  to
haathon main rang rah jaataa hai  pankhons se jab chodo to
vakt chalata hai  vakt kaa magar rang utarataa hai  akira
udateudate phir ek lamhaa maine pakad liya re

jiya  jiya re  jiya re
jiya  jiya re  jiya re
jiya  jiya re  jiya re
    

jiya re  jiya re
jiya  jiya re  jiya re
jiya  jiya re  jiya re
    

ayy  ayy
make the way for akira  ayy  ayy

halkehalke pardon main muskuraana acha lagata hai
roshni jo detaa ho  to dil jalaana acha lagata hai
ek pal sahi  umr bhar ise saath rakhana  akira
zindagi se phir ek vaada maine kar liya re

jiya  jiya re  jiya re

jiya  jiya re  jiya re
    

jiya re  jiya re
jiya  jiya re  jiya re

chali re  chali re  junun ko liye
pinjre se uda dil kaa shikara
khud hi se maine ishq kiya re

jiya  jiya re  jiya re
