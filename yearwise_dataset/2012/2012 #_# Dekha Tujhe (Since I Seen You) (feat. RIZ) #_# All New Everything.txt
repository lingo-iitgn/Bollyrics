 yeah this ones one of those thank you songs cuz im just really happy to have you and i got a little somethin to say to you nazare yu mili
dil mera kho gaya
teri aankhon ka hi hai nasha hai khumaar
chahat ye meri
tere hi pyar ki
jaane kaise ye badhane lagi beshumar
jaaneja
ab tu meri ban gayi jeene ki wajah
jaaneja
hai tu meri manzil hai tu hi daastaan
dekja tujhe to na jaane
bechain bhari ratein aur
sari mushkilain pal mein kaise door ho gayi x
since i seen your face
felt your warm embrace
my whole worlds in a daze
and i dont know what ima do without you
i dont wanna wait
spend my time in vain
with every beat of my heart
im tryna be with you
tell me why
i cannot be with you every single night
tell me why
you drive me crazy i just wanna be the one that calls you baby
dekja tujhe to na jaane
bechain bhari ratein aur
sari mushkilain pal mein kaise door ho gayi x
na na na dekja tujhe to na jaane
bechain bhari ratein aur
sari mushkilain pal mein kaise door ho gayi x
