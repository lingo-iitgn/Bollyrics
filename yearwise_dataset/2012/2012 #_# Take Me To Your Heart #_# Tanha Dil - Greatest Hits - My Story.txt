 sham ke saye jab odha ke din so jataa hai
dil ke andheron mein ek cheharaa jhilmilata hai
kabhi woh sharamaaye kabhi haske kuchh kahe
iss dil ko churaake iss dil mein hi rahein

take me to your heart take me to your soul
tujhsa nahi kuchh bhi anmol
tere intezaar mein kab se hai hum
iss dil ke darwaaje khol
kehte hai rehtaa nahi jahaan mein
kuchh bhi sadaa ke liye
phir bhi sab kuchh bhulaa ke teri raah pe chal diye

take me to your heart take me to your soul
give me your hand and hold me
show me what love is be my guiding star
its easy take me to your heart

kaisa ye rishta hai tere mere darmayaan
kaisi ye chaahat hai kaise karu bayaan

dont need too much talking without saying anything
all i need is someone who makes me wanna sing

take me to your heart take me to your soul
tujhsa nahi kuchh bhi anmol
show me what love is havnt got a clue
iss dil ke darawaaje khol

they say nothing last forever
we are only here today
phir bi sab kuch bhulaa ke tere raah pe chal diye

take me to your heart take me to your soul
give me your hand and hold me
show me what love is be my guiding star
its easy take me to your heart

kaisa ye rishta hai tere mere darmayaan
kaisi ye chaahat hai kaise karu bayaan

dont need too much talking without saying anything
all i need is someone who makes me wanna sing

take me to your heart take me to your soul
tujhsa nahi kuchh bhi anmol
show me what love is havnt got a clue
iss dil ke darawaaje khol

they say nothing last forever
we are only here today
phir bi sab kuch bhulaa ke tere raah pe chal diye

take me to your heart take me to your soul
give me your hand and hold me
show me what love is be my guiding star
its easy take me to your heart
