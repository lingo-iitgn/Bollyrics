those who i met up in the past
become a flash
when the futures taking pictures without
permission to ask
where to ash
when ya life is a bucket of broken glass
and the hope is that youll make it
to the bottom of the flask
i met a lonely soul
how cuz she told me so
who could be that open door
to let me in and see their gold
when they come for my water and land
i become the father protecting land and sand

ranjhna ve tuhinyon meri hoand maahiya
ranjhna ve tuhinyon meri hoand maahiya
sang tere sajna jude mere saah sang tere sajna jude mere saah 
tuhinyon meri hoand tuhinyon meri hoand

its a gimmick and you live it
like a winner try na win it
im an image that is given you a mirror take a minute
and reflect all the stress
that you accumulate
now compress
the depth of ya tense and
foolish fate
who to hate
a question that the rulers
break strategically
and choose the place of every
immigrant today
there comes a time and place to speak the truth
my brain carries no concept of either so tell me what do i 
kha a llaba
ehtefel al hayat
ehtefel al hayat

hayat jameelan
hayat mlouwan
hayat jaleelan

ranjhna ve ishqeda rabb maniya ranjhna ve ishqeda rabb maniya akhiyaan nu teri aas lage
akhiyaan nu teri aas lage

ishqeda rabb maniya ve

ji huzoori sada teri hai chau chadheya

ji huzoori sada teri hai chau chadheya
