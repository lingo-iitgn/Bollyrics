 ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
kastiya bhi lad gayee
the boats have also been loaded

mastiya bhi mil gayee jaaneman
enjoyment also has been realised o my life

raat kali so gayee
the dark night has gone to sleep

roshani bhi ho gayee jaaneman
light has broken out

subah tak hum ladte rahe
we had kept on fighting till the dawn

jeene ko hum marte rahe
we kept on dieing in the desire to live

ghaas bani hai talware
the grassneedles have become swords

phool bane hai angaare jaaneman
the flowers have become flames o my life

jaaneman
o my life
aayenge ab to baadal bhi
even the clouds will now arrive

bheegega ab to aanchal bhi
even the scarf will now get drenched

jindagi hogi apni jindagi
life will be our life

kastiya bhi lad gayee
mastiya bhi mil gayee jaaneman
raat kali so gayee
roshani bhi ho gayee jaaneman

palko mein phoolo ke rang barse
the colors of flowers have showered in the eyelids

gaalo pe aansoo ki rangoli
the tears have drawn a painting on the cheeks

main yaha tu waha ladte rahe
i here and you kept on fighting there

khatm ye jang jaane kab hogi
who knows when this war will end

maine tujhko ye dil jabse diya
ever since i have given my heart to you

kaanto pe gujaara tabse kiya
since then i have been staying on the thorns

mera jeevan tere bin soona
my life is empty without you

khaabo mein rah gaya
remained in a dream

saajan se bichhad ke
having got separated from my lover

ab to kastiya bhi lad gayee
mastiya bhi mil gayee jaaneman
raat kali so gayee
roshani bhi ho gayee jaaneman

la
jaaneman jaaneman tere vastey
o my life for your sake

aaya hu udh ke hawaao mein
i have arrived flying on the airs

phoolo mein hoti hai jyo khushboo
the fragrance that is there in the flowers

waisi hi tu meri sanso mein
you are also like that in my breaths

tere paao ki paayal ban jaaoo
may i become the silver ring adorning your feet

tere nayno ka kaajal ban ke rahoo
may i become the black paste that adorns your eyes

mere dil ki tu hai rani
you are the emperess of my heart

le lu aa baaho mein
i want to hold you in my arms

tujh mein hi mil jaaoo main
i wish to mingle in you

ab to kastiya bhi lad gayee
mastiya bhi mil gayee jaaneman
raat kali so gayee
roshani bhi ho gayee jaaneman
subah tak hum ladte rahe
jeene ko hum marte rahe
ghaas bani hai talware
phool bane hai angaare jaaneman
jaaneman
aayenge ab to baadal bhi
bheegega ab to aanchal bhi
jindagi hogi apni jindagi
