 saahib mera ek hai duja kaha na jaaye
duja saahib jo kahun saahib khada 
my master is one without a second
if i see multiplicity it is also my masters 
maali aavat dekh ke kaliyaan kare pukar
phool phool chun liye kaal hamari 
seeing the master gardener the buds whisper to each other
fully blossomed ones are plucked away our appointed day is 
chhah gayi chinta miti manva beparvah
jinko kachu na chaiye woh hi 
if cravings are dissolved worries go mind becomes free
he who wants nothing is surely the king of all 
het preet sun jo mile ta ko miliye dhaaye
antar raakhe jo mile taase mile 
you hasten to meet the ones who meet you with love
those who meet you with a pure heart have indeed found a friend 
kabira te nar andh hai guru ko kehte aur
har roothe guru chhod hain guru roothe nahi

but there is no refuge after one is refused at the door of a 
karta tha to kyun raha ab kahe pachhtaye
bove pe babool ka aam kahan se 
heedless i committed innumerable wrongs now i suffer
nurturing the thistles of a barren tree can one expect mango

sab dharti kaagad karun lekhan sab ban raaye
saat samand ki muss karun guru gun likha na 
if the entire earth is a writing tablet all the forest be its pen
all waters of seven seas be its ink  even then the lords praises remain 
ab guru dil mein dekheya gaavan ko kachhu naahin
kabira jab tum gaavate tab jana guru 
once the lord is recognized within the heart there is nothing left to be told
kabir whenever you tried to utter the mysteries the knowledge of your master 
main laaga uss ek se ek bhaya sab maahin
sab mera main saban ka tihan doosara 
i am attached with that one the one who is with all
when everyone is mine and i am everyones there ends all 
ja marne se jag dare mere man anand
kab mar hun kab paahun puran 
the world trembles at the thought of death but its a matter of joy for me
when shall i die when shall i find the perfect joy of the vision of the beloved

sab ban to chandan nahi shoore ke dal nahi
sab samundra moti nahi yun sadhu jag 
neither all forests are of sandalwoods nor all teams are full of valiant warriors
nor all seas are filled with pearls likewise the real gnostics of god are truly 
jab hum jag mein pag dharyo sab hanse hum roye
kabira ab aisi kar chalo paache hansi na 
when you came to this mortal world everyone around you were happy to see you
and you were the only one kabir now be in this world such that none laugh at your behind
but you yourself depart the world laughing leaving all weeping 
agun kiye to bahu kiye karat na mani haar
bhaven banda bhakshe bhaaven gardan 
tirelessly so many misdeeds have been committed
now that ive realized o lord do as you 
sadhu bhukha bhaav ka dhan ka bhookha naahin
dhan ka bhookha jo phire so to saadhu 
having no appetite for material wealth true saints are hungry only for love
those who thirst after material wealth are not saintly at 
saahib sun sab hott hai bande te kachhu naahin
rai te parbat kare parbat rai 
listen friend this world has nothing for you vanity of seriously narrow is the passage to salvation smaller even than the mustard 
jyun til mahi tel hai jyun chakmak mein aag
tera sain tujh mein base jaag sake to 
oil is found inside the sesame seed inside flinstone is fire like that
your lord is within now awaken to that truth if you dare
