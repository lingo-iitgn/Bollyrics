 you wont get much closer
until you sacrifice it all all
you wont get to taste it
with your face against the wall wall wall

get up and commit
show the power trapped within in in
do just what you want to
and now stand up and begin uh

ooh     fires in eyes
and this chaos it defies imagination
ooh    minus  lives
youve arrived at panic station

doubts will try to break you
unleash your heart and soul soul
trouble will surround you
start taking some control trol

stand up and deliver
your wildest fantasy sy sy
do what the fuck you want to
theres no one to appeeease

ooh     fires in eyes
and this chaos it defies imagination
ooh    minus  lives
youve arrived at panic station

ooh     fires in eyes
and this chaos it defies imagination
ooh    minus  lives
and i know that you will fight for the duration
ooh     fires in eyes
and you know im not resisting your temptations
ooh    minus  lives
youve arrived at panic station
