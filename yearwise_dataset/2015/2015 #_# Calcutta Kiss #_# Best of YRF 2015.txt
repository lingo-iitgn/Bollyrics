 do you know what time it is
dont know what time it is
dont care what time it is
coz its time for cal calcutta kiss woh saaboyeh le charas ka tola
chhod de kurtajhola
bhai lagta hai tu bhola
aakhri raat tedhi baat
khaali botal tere haath
pa ra ra ra pa ra ra 
feeling so blue
feeling so blue and yellow
feeling so blue
coz i lost my time teller

do you know what time it is
dont know what time it is
dont care what time it is
coz its time for cal calcutta kiss

mason saab kahaan thhe aap
fizool gaye thhe chaar minar
ulta chasma angoothe chaar
kyun chalayi vilayati car
reeta thhi badi makkaar
tina thhi chakku ki dhaar
lut gaye pit gaye chhodo yaar
feeling so blue
feeling so blue and yellow
feeling so blue
coz i lost my time teller

meri jaan tu aasmaan se utarke jaayega kahaan
meri jaan raat ko nikaawaara
par dhayein dhayein jab goliyaan chali
darr gaya bechaara

do you know what time it is
dont know what time it is
dont care what time it is
coz its time for cal calcutta kiss

do you know what time it is
dont know what time it is
dont care what time it is
coz its time for cal calcutta kiss
