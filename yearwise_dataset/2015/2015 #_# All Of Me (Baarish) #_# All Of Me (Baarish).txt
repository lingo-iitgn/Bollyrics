 yaariyaan veyaariyaan ve
i give you all of me
baby cant you see that
i really mean it
and you caste a spell on me
im intoxicated
its complicated
you know i need you right now
we can turn this around

main poori nayi ho 
girl you got to have faith in me
mirror mirror mirror on the wall tell me
who is the most vicious of em all i got
so drunk so drunk drunk on your perfume
that i got wasted on you

milne ko tujhse bahaane karun
tu muskuraaye wajah main banun
roz bitaana saath mein tere saara din mera

is dardedil ki sifaarish
ab kar de koi yahaan
ki mill jaaye isey woh baarish
jo bhiga de poori tarah

is dardedil ki sifaarish
ab kar de koi yahaan
ki mill jaaye isey woh baarish
jo bhiga de poori tarah

cause im fumbling to find words
to say ill never hurt you
i dont deserve you and
im down here on bended knee
you gotta hear my story
i said im sorry

mirror mirror mirror on the wall tell me
who is the most wicked of em all i got
so drunk so drunk drunk on your perfume
that i got wasted on you

girl i just cant go on without ya
i know that you love me
hear me out i never meant to hurt ya
no no no excuses
i wanna do all right
give me second chance
im about to lose my mind
baby come back to me

is dardedil ki sifaarish
ab kar de koi yahaan
ki mill jaaye isey woh baarish
jo bhiga de poori tarah

is dardedil ki sifaarish
ab kar de koi yahaan
ki mill jaaye isey woh baarish
jo bhiga de poori tarah

i gave you all of me
baby cant you see that
i really mean it
and you caste a spell on me
im intoxicated
you know i need you right now
we can turn this around

so drunk so drunk drunk on your perfume
that i got wasted on you im such a fool

milne ko tujhse bahaane karun
tu muskuraaye wajah main banun
roz bitaana saath mein tere saara din mera

is dardedil ki sifaarish
ab kar de koi yahaan
ki mill jaaye isey woh baarish
jo bhiga de poori tarah

is dardedil ki sifaarish
ab kar de koi yahaan
ki mill jaaye isey woh baarish
jo bhiga de poori tarah
