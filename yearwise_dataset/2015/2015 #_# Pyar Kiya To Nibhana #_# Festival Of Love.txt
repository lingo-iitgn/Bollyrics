ab zindagi kaa makasad

ab zindagi kaa makasad
he bas tumhaara saath
lo kah diya yah tumse

haathon main leki haath
ham tum  tum ham banake rahe
humaraaz hamasafar

shikawa kare na koi
ek duje se umr bhar
pyaar hamaara ho aise ke

na main tumhe sataaun
na tum mujhe satao
main tumko samaj jaaun
tum mujhako samaj jaao
na main tumhe sataaun
na tum mujhe satao
main tumko samaj jaaun
tum mujhako samaj jaao
chahat hi puja ho
man mandir ho jaaneman
ek duje ke bin
ek pal bhi lagata nahin ho man
phir to jivan ban jayega
pyaar kaa taraana
pyaar kiya to nibhaana
pyaar kiya to nibhaana
pyaar kiya to nibhaana
pyaar kiya to nibhaana
kahata he pal pal tumse
hoke dil yah divaana
kahata he pal pal tumse
hoke dil yah divaana
ek pal bhi jane janaa
mujhase dur nahin janaa
pyaar kiya to nibhaana
