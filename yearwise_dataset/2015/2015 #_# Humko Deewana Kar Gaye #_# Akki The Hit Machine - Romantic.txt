 dil ko na tha pata
my heart had no 
do juda saanson ko kyon mideti hai
why does it knit together two separate lives

dil ko na tha pata
my heart had no 
milke bhi ham mil na sakein

zakhm dil ke sil na sakein
we couldnt heal the wounds in our 
na takaraate to achchha tha
it would have been better had we not confronted each other

bhuul jo paate to achchha tha
better if we could have just managed to 
tu phir se milke jaana
but when i met you again i realized
