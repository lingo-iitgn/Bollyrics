 jhulati hai jhoo she is swinging like a swing
mamta ki chaya  the shadow of her love
maa ka dulara  falls upon her loving son
jaga muskaya  waking up with a smile

sundar tha  it was beautiful
sapna sa tha  it was like a dream
soya tha usi or  as i slept on that spot
jahan meri maa ke thi god  where is my mothers lap
dheeray say mujh ko sude meri maa  let me sleep again slowly oh mom

paas tu jo naa rahe to  if you are not staying with me
siskiyan le kar mein ro dun  i would weap a lot and cry
maa mujhe aa ke to de do hos please come and give me courage
sehday  stroke me
behday  disperse me
seenay say mujh ko laga lay  hug me

wohi lory gaa phir se  the same song sing it again
nindiya ko tu jaga day  wake me up again
dheeray se mujh ko sude  let me sleep again slowly oh mom
meri maa  my mom
meri maa  my mom

jhulati hai jhoo she is swinging like a swing
mamta ki chaya  the shadow of her love
maa ka dulara  falls upon her loving son
jaga muskaya  waking up with a smile

sukh mein dukh mein jo sath thee  in happiness amp sadness she was near
palak jhapaktay hi ko gayiii  disappeared in seconds
lamha lamha jo paas thee  every moment she was with me
door mujh se ho gayii  going far away from me
saza se bhi hai ye zyada  this is more than a punishment
teray bin ik pal jeeena  living a second without you
amma  mother
amma mother
amma  mother

paas tu jo naa rahe to  if you are not staying with me
siskiyan le kar mein ro dun  i would weap a lot and cry
maa mujhe aa ke to de do hos please come and give me courage
sehday  stroke me
behday  disperse me
seenay say mujh ko laga lay  hug me

wohi lory gaa phir se  the same song sing it again
nindiya ko tu jaga day  wake me up again
dheeray se mujh ko sude  let me sleep again slowly oh mom
meri maa  my mom
meri maa  my mom

jhulati hai jhoo she is swinging like a swing
mamta ki chaya  the shadow of her love
maa ka dulara  falls upon her loving son
jaga muskaya  waking up with a smile
