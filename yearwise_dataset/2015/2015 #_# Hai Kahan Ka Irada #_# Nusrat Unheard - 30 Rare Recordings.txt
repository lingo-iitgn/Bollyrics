 faslegul hai sharaab pii leejiye
zid na keejiye janaab pii leejiye

it is the season of flowers intoxicate yourself
dont be so persistent intoxicate 
maikashon mujh tak ye ghanghor ghatayen aayiin
tum pe rahmat huii taubaa pe balaayen aayiin

o imbibers the heavycast clouds burst forth to me
its mercy for you and misfortune for 
pii leejiye

intoxicate 
jhuumtii qiblaa se ghanghor ghataayen aayiin hain

swaying dark clouds have come from the direction of 
ab to pii leejiye

at least now intoxicate 
sheikh jii thorii sii pii lo aaj to
kaun dekhegaa andherii raat hai

o abstinent drink a little at least today
the night is dark and no one would 
muskuraao bahaar ke din hain
gul khilao bahaar ke din hain
mai nahiin to ashqegham hi sahi
pii bhi jaao bahaar ke din hain

smile as it is let the flowers bloom in the days of if there is no wine then drink the tears of suffering
drink as these are the days of 
jaa ke dil sad baaraa sii lo
kuch der to bekhudii men jii lo

go forth and sew the wounds of heart
live in the state of unconsciousness for some why so much restraint o abstinent

one has to give an account on the day of judgment
so drink as much as you 
dodo qatre hain jaam ke andar

just two drops are in the glass
drink them up under the guise of 
jo piye chhup ke vo munaafiq hai
betakalluf sharaab pii leejiye

one who drinks furtively is a hypocrite
drink without any 
dil kaa shiisha hai aur khuluus ki mai
ab to aaliijanaab pii leejiye

glass is of heart and wine is of faith
now dear sir drink now at 
jaavidaanii suruur aayegaa
aasmaanii gulaab pii leejiye

heavenly intoxication will engulf drink the heavenly 
aap aur itnii zid adam saahab
harj kyaa hai sharaab pii leejiye
