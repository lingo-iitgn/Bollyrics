 dard dilo ke kam ho jaate
main aur tum agar hum ho jaate
main aur tum agar hum ho jaate

dont play well cant you see it
how everyone knows about you and me
jaane kyun itni haseen hai
you are breaking my heart
in them skinny jeans

now we dont leave like
to bring a lot away
pocket full of love
cant just wait and see
how could we be losing
if we are winning it
so stay right here and dont let go

dil tod na mainu apna le
you already know
duniya de ghaman nu bhuke
main aur tum gar hum ho jaate
main aur tum gar hum ho jaate

lets turn this around make it easy
how long we gonna be
creeping in and out
hum dono ki yahi takdir hain
there never be unless we dont do now

now we dont leave like
to bring a lot away
pocket full of love
cant just wait and see
how could we be losing
if we are winning it
just stay right here and dont let go

dil tod na mainu apna le
you already know
duniya de ghaman nu bhuke
main aur tum gar hum ho jate
main aur tum gar hum ho jate

i know you will wait for me girl
dont know how long we got
but we will make it work
you let me wants to love me
cuz it hurts

let me love you tonight love you tonight
cuz you are made to be loved
there are many signs
you are my angel on earth
you will let be wants it gets me
twice still it burns
let me love you love me tonight
love me tonight

girl dil tod na mainu apna le
you already know
duniya di gham nu ko bhulake

main aur tum gar hum ho jaate
main aur tum gar hum ho jaate
door woh sare bharam ho jaate
main aur tum agar hum ho jaate

we were united united we stay
yeah i would be simple
girl if you would be mine
kitna haseen aalam ho jaate
main aur tum gar hum ho jaate
main aur tum gar hum ho jaate
main aur tum gar hum ho jaate
