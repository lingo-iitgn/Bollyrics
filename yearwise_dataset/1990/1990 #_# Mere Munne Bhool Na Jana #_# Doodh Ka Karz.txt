 jab se faaslay bade
hum roye lade
hum jaage na soye hum dur dur the khade
ego bade dil chote jaise sikke ho khote
jo khwaab neend ko chod ke gaye woh wapas fir na laute
aaj kya hai tere mere pass
tere mere halaat bhi hasaas
saza lagti hai har saans
har saans ke saath badhe ehsaas
kuch khaas baat hai tujh mein jo baaki ladkiyo mein dikhti nahi
kyun ke koi aur meri liye magazines mein likhti nai
mujhe pata hai mein duniya ke liye hu sirf ek rapper
aaj mein hu toh kal koi aur mojud hoga meri jagah par
par dil mein tere meri jaga rahegi maqsoos
log sirf sunte hain mujhe tune kiya hai mehsoos
zindagi baaki hai kum aur ye hai rab ke hukum ke tu aur mein nahi ho payege kabhi bhi hum
meri majboori ko magroori mat samjho jaana
zindagi yahi toh hain anaa aur chale jaana

tune mere jaana
kabhi nahi jaana
ishq mera dard mera ashiq tera bhid mein khoya
jaaga na soya oh jaana

staring out the window pane waiting for a better day
though its been years it seems like yesterday
cold nights hand in hand
paradise no human land
im feeling down with a sickness and i feel so done
cant even believe that its really all gone
gone miles with the wind
even if i wish it back
wont bring it back again

girl i can see it in your eyes that youre scared
when the hell was coming down you were unprepared
i needed the deck of aces i was unaware
its the coldest of truths we breath in the same air
i played and i saw you scatter
now i can not believe that i had her
i had the love that wouldnt come to me
if i had to walk a thousand miles but i fucked up
now im cuffed up reminiscing old times
putting my head in your lap under the cold pines
who knew i was planting them land mines
and you stepped onem
you were probing no signs
oh my
now i hate myself when i think
i couldve been the one to put the diamond ring in your finger
but see the love wasnt a fucking thing to me now
sssshhh
let this titanic 
tune mere jaana
kabhi nahi jaana
ishq mera dard mera ashiq tera bhid mein khoya
jaaga na soya oh jaana

bridge

mein sabse puchu ke tumko mein yaad aata hu kab kab
wo haskar kehte bas masroof na ho jab jab
aur phir wo mujhse puche ke mujhko tum yaad aate ho kab kab
mein haskar kehta saans leta hu jab 
tune mere jaana
kabhi nahi jaana
ishq mera dard mera ashiq tera bhid mein khoya
jaaga na soya oh jaana
