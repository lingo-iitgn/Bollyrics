teri life mein bhi chaar dwaar hai
do dwaar aage do dwaar pichhe
duniya ka ye game hai
jab tu udta hai woh kheeche niche

cheekhe aur chillaaye jo
gaddhe se kuchh paayega
seete woh jab phatti unki
woh udd ke dikhaayega

hatt ja pichhe
le kadam chhote tera ab time khatam
karle tu apni party band
ab time hai tere bhai ka
loha ab hai garam
hatt jaane mein no sharam
tu phuljadhi main hoon item bomb

ab bhai tera bajaayega
gaane mere chalenge
ab main sabko nachaaega
khaane ki chinta nahi
jo boega so payega

bang
jaane anjaane main bana dj apne life ka
maane ya na maane tu
main favorite tere wife ka
