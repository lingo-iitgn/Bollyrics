 tere liye main laayi hoon nasha
tere liye jaadu hai yeh jagaah
o karle phir taiyaariyaan
hone de aankhon ki yaariyaan
ik raat ki hi baat hai pyaar nahi hai koi crime
ishq karle anytime anytime anytime
ishq karle anytime anytime anytime
ishq karle anytime anytime anytime
ishq karle anytime anytime anytime
hum teri hotti si adaa
meri naughty nas pe fidaa
tune jo mujhko chhuaan
mujhe something saa huaa
bhadki hai saanson mein chingaariyaan
ik raat ki hi baat hai pyaar nahi hai koi crime
ishq karle anytime anytime anytime
ishq karle anytime anytime anytime
ho ye ladki kamaal hai
ho jo aaj mere naal hai
oo dil ka bura haal hai
oo mach gaya bawaal hai
kaisi pyar ki maya mujhko
pyar ne itna bhagaya
main dilli wali chhod ke seedha
iske pichhe aaya
to phir ishq tu karle baby
dil mujhko tu degi
to mai pyar karunga itna
tu ho jayegi crazy
ho aankhon red wine teri
pee loon na karu main teri
tally hai ye hum hai sabhi
karle jo hai karna abhi
saari hi teri hai khumaariyan
ik raat ki hi baat hai pyaar nahi hai koi crime
ishq karle anytime anytime anytime
ishq karle anytime anytime anytime
ishq karle anytime anytime anytime
ishq karle anytime anytime anytime
ishq karle anytime anytime anytime
ishq karle anytime anytime anytime
