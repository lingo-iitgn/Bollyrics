 bade buudhon ne kaha he munni
saj dhajana bura he munni
be careful aag lagegi
jo tu sajegi sabaki bajegi

laa lipstick laake
main ton chalanaa e short skirt paake
main ton naachna e club  aake

jo tu sajegi sabaki bajegi
he       
he       
he main tere sadake sadake dil
      
laaj sharam chhad

laaj sharam chhad aaj sharam chhad
laaj sharam chhad aaj sharam chhad
laaj sharam chhad aaj sharam chhad

laaj sharam chhad aaj sharam chhad

dance baby dance kyon hoti tu he shy
sab chhod ke sharam dance floor pe aae
thodaa step to dikhaae agar step nahi aae
to haath uthaa ke phir bhangda paae

chhod ke sharam naacho chhod ke sharam
karo floor ko garam
todphod do rythme

thodi garmi main gin or sardi main rum
aise life ko hai jite ham chhod ke sharam
chhod ke sharam
chhod ke sharam

chaahe zamana maare yah taana
fark naa  

laaj sharam chhad aaj sharam chhad
laaj sharam chhad aaj sharam chhad
kar naa  oye janu

laaj sharam chhad aaj sharam chhad
laaj sharam chhad aaj sharam chhad

he

he main tere sadake sadake dil

laaj sharam chhad aaj sharam chhad
laaj sharam chhad aaj sharam chhad
laaj sharam chhad aaj sharam chhad
laaj sharam chhad naa

laaj sharam chhad aaj sharam chhad
laaj sharam chhad aaj sharam chhad
laaj sharam chhad aaj sharam chhad
laaj sharam chhad naa
