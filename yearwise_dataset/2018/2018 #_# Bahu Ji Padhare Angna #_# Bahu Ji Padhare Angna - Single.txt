 well see its like this and its as plain and simple as the nose on my face ohohoh 
if you were sharing a braincell with another youd still be an fancy shmancy antsy 
why a choo choo train dont have no reason to be polite uhwohuhohuhoh
ah but then to be a choo choo youd have to be on the right track

your case in point did never come as and i dont wanna change anyone cos theyre the only thing that shouldve never have been 
inside my head im comin out of a loaded gun
colliding with everyone staining tiles with blood trails leading right out of the 
you could still fight to see if you wont
but if you ask me now its never unknown what youll eventualy do
know what youre about to 
so wont you sacrifice today
wont you give away a piece of now to get back yesterday

you could still try to make it but if you ask me now the place where you are is never unknown
