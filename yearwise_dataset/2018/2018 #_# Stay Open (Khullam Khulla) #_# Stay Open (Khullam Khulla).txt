 kya lena dena zamaane se koi
apna toh rasta apna hi hai
andheron se hai rishta nahi
apni toh har raat subah si hai

ki baanhon ko apni hai khole rakhna hai
dil ke darwaaze khule sabke liye
jitni meri hai utni teri
ye duniya apni hai khullam khulla

you got to keep your heart open
khullan khulkhullan khulla
stay open for love hearts open
khullan khulkhullan khulla

oh baby my hearts open
you know that i stay open for you

stay open

kisi ke kehne pe chalta nahi
iraada apna toh naya hi hai
ujaalon ki hai zidd ki bujhna nahi
apni toh har raat subah si hai

baanhon ko apni hai khole rakhna hai
dil ke darwaaze khule sabke liye
jitni meri hai utni teri hai
duniya apni hai khullam khulla

you got to keep your heart open
khullan khulkhullan khulla
stay open for love hearts open
khullan khulkhullan khulla

oh baby my hearts open
you know that i stay open for you

stay open

its the same with me and you and everybody
hold on tight our breath while waiting for the party

so many doors so many closed to us
oh baby my hearts open
you know that i stay open

pass down the line standing outside the club
oh baby my hearts open
you know that i stay open for you
