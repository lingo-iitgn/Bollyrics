 main talkhiye hayat se ghabra ke pee gaya
gham ki siyaah raat se ghabra ke pee gaya

chalke hue the jam pareshan thi zulf e yaar
kuch aisay hadsaat se ghabra ke pee gaya

main aadmi hoon koi farishta nahi huzoor
main aaj apni zaat se ghabra ke pee gaya

itni daqeeq shai koi kaisay samajh sakay
yazdaan ke waqiyaat se ghabra ke pee gaya

kantay to khair kantay hi hain unse gihi kya
phoolon ki wardaat se ghabra ke pee gaya

dunia e hadsaat hai aik dardnaak geet
dunia e hadsaat se ghabra ke pee gaya

saghar wo keh rahe the ke pee lijiye huzoor
un ki guzarishaat se ghabra ke pee gaya
