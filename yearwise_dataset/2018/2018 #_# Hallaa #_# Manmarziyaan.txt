 laaiyaan chhad ke kitthe chalhai
where are you going away leaving all your possessions
baseya na yeh pyaar muhalhai
this neighbourhood of love has not been formed
andar kuch te tutt ke gireya hai
something has broken inside and fallen down
naina bhar aaye
my eyes are weeping

mann vich halhalhalhai
theres a turmoil inside my head
pyaar tu kalkalkalhai
love you are a lonesome being
naam mohabbat da koi na mallah hai
daaman na koi aas na palhai
theres no refuge or shelter
mann vich halhalhalhai
theres a turmoil inside my head
pyaar tu kalkalkalhai
love you are a lonesome being

ishqe lafz da e tutt ke gireya lafz da
e tutt ke gireya lafz da e tutt ke gireya hai
a syllable from the word love has broken and fallen
ae ishqe
o love

mann vich halhalhalhai
theres a turmoil inside my head
pyaar tu kalkalkalhai
love you are a lonesome being
naam mohabbat da koi na mallah hai
the name of love isnt comparable to any sailor
daaman na koi aas na palhai
theres no refuge or shelter
mann vich halhalhalhai
theres a turmoil inside my head

ishqe lafz da e tutt ke gireya lafz da
e tutt ke gireya lafz da e tutt ke gireya hai
a syllable from the word love has broken and fallen
ae ishqe
o love

berang shaam de saaye ne
the colourless shades of the evening
chott karan nu aaye ne
have come to wound everyone
ulfat de rang udd gaye ne
the colours of love have all faded off
saare nazaare chidh gaye ne
all the sceneries are upset

berang shaam de saaye ne
the colourless shades of the evening

saare nazaare chidh gaye ne
all the sceneries are upset

mann vich halhalhalhai
theres a turmoil inside my head
pyaar tu kalkalkalhai
love you are a lonesome being

aaaa aaa

mann vich halhalhalhai
theres a turmoil inside my head
pyaar tu kalkalkalhai
love you are a lonesome being
