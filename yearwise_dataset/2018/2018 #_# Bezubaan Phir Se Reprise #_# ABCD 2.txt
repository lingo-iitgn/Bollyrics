 tuuti hai ruthi hai
hatho se chhutii hai
mana teri raushnee
gehara andheraa hai do pal ko thehara hai
rang aasmaanon kaa bhi
aasaan raaho ko tuune liya kab hai
ziddee savere tere
apane se vaadon ke sau sau iraadon ke
dil me basere tere

wo jo kah paae naa jubaan teri
wo aankhe teri karade bayaan
paanv tere kahin roke rukenge naa
ho khud pe yakeen jo tera

teri kahani teri zubaani
sunegaa ye sara jahaan
bejubaan kab se tu rahaa
begunaah sahataa kyun rahaa
bejubaan

when i am on the spare
and i only feeling doubt
when i am all alone
he was start to think about suffocting silence
and a consequence ahead
now the only difference is confidence ahead
should we started at the summer
saying never up ahead
to all the temperature that high
for another last july
to all the level that decided
and every look that resides
and i keep it that level standard
with the name she denies

wo ho khwabo kaa tere kissa hai
tera haq tera hissaa hai
tujhse naa chhine jahaan

teri intehaan dekhegaa
aaj aasmaan dekhegaa
kya hai tera faisla
bejubaan kab se tu rahaa
begunaah sahataa kyun rahaa
bejubaan kab se tu rahaa

begunaah sahataa kyun rahaa
i dont wanna not be livin cause what could happen
who you tellin me to be something i can manage
feelin like im ready after carrying all this baggage
it used to be challenge and it switch to an advantage
toughened by the failure and now strengthened by victory
feedin of the pain even though its contradictory
misery is something that i see as a mystery
periphery is empty and rest is move to history
teri intehaan dekhegaa
aaj aasmaan dekhegaa
kya hai tera fais
