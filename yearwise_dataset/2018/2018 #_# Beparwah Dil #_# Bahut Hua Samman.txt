 hai nadaan sa kabhi
kabhi sharaaraten bhi tu karata hai
naa sunata hai kisi kii
manamaniyaan bas apni karata hai

tu anjaanaa
hai baton se teri i diwane kya tu jane
ye aadaten hai sari puraani
tu baaj aae na kabhi

beparwaah had
beparwaah had
tu aisa kyun he  tu jane na
beparwaah had
beparwaah had
tu aisa kyun hai

beparwaah had
beparwaah had
tu aisa kyun he  tu jane na
beparwaah had
beparwaah had
tu aisa kyun hai

naasamajh bane tu
samajhataa par sabhi
har banatibigadati
chizon main sambhavlata bhi
