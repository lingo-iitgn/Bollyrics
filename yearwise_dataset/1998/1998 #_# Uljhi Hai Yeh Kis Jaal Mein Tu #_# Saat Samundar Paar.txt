yeh roop hai kyun damka
why is your guise shining
yeh rang hai kyun chamka
why is your colourcolour of the body glittering
yeh saans teri mehki hai kyun
why is your breath fragranced

yeh masti hai kyun chhalki
why is this intoxication overflowing from you
yeh chunri hai kyun dhalki
why is the chunari slipping
chunari is a cloth covering the top of a dress and sometimes even used a veil a scarf
yeh chaal teri behki hai kyun

kyun aag si hai tan mein
why is there some kind of fire in your body
kuch to hai tere mann mein
something is there in your heart for sure
tu aise machalti hai kyun
why are you dancing in this way

hai kaisa nasha chhaaya
what kind of intoxication is spread over you
kisne tujhe behkaaya
who has made you so wayward
tu girti sambhalti hai kyun
why do you keep on tripping

kyun mehka hai yeh gajra
why is the flower garland in your hair fragranced
kya kehta hai yeh kajra
what is the kohl in your eyes saying
tu sapnon mein khoyi hai kyun
why are you lost in a dreamworld

bechain hain kyun naina
why are your eyes restless
kyun khoya tune chaina
why is your peace lost
na jaagi na soyi hai kyun
why do you seem neither asleep nor awake
