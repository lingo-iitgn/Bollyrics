 tum ho meri nigaahon pe chhaayi
you are in my sight

tum ho saanson pe jaise samaayi
as if you have got mingled in my breaths

bolo kaun ho bolo kaun ho bolo na
say who you are please say

tum ho ye chaandani saath laayi
you have brought this moonbeam with you

tum ho kushbu mein jaise nahaayi
as if you have taken bath in the fragrance

bolo kaun ho bolo kaun ho bolo na
say who you are please say

jaane kyuun laga mujhe ki jaise hasin
i dont know how i got a nuch that o beauty

tum mujhe kisi janam mein ho mili kahin
you had met me in any previous life

chehara jaise jaanaapahachaana
you face is quite familiar

jisane mujhako kiya divaana
that has made me possessed

bolo kaun ho bolo na
say who you are please say

yuun lage mujhe ki tum ho koyi raagini
i feel as if you are some tune

yuun lage ki saanche mein dhali hai chaandani
i feel as if moonlight has got molded in a cast

ujalaaujaruup jo dekhuun gumasumgumasum hairaan sa huun
when i see such a bright beauty i am lost i thought and somewhat amazed

bolo kaun ho bolo na
say who you are please say

tum jo apani ho na paraayi
you who are neigther mine nor somebody elses

tum jo yuun paas ho mere aaye
you who have come near to me like this

jaise laharonlaharon naav chale
as if a boat is moving over the waves

jaise haulehaule phuul khile
as if a flower is blooming slowly slowly

jaise kvaab koyi aaye aankhon mein
as if some dream has come in the eyes

jaise geet koyi aaye honthon mein
as if some song comes to the lips

tum ho meri nigaahon pe chhaayi
tum ho saanson pe jaise samaayi
bolo kaun ho bolo kaun ho bolo na
bolo na bolo na bolo na
