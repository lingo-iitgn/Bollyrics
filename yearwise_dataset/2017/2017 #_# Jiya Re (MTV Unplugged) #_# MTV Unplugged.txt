 chali re chali re
junoon ko liye
katra katra lamho ko diye
pinjre se uda dil ka shikra
khudi se maine ishq kiya re

jiya jiya re jiya re
jiya jiya re jiya re
jiya jiya re jiya re jiya oh

jiya jiya re jiya re
jiya jiya re jiya re
jiya jiya re jiya re jiya oh

chali re chali re
junoon ko liye
pinjre se uda dil ka shikra
khudi se maine ishq kiyaaa re
jiya jiya re jiya 
make the way for akira is the character played by anushka sharma
pop it up move aside she is here
hey get up everybody wanna be her
wanna see her she is akira

chhote chhote lamho ko teetli jaise pakdo toh
haathon mein rang reh jaata hai
pankho se jab chhodo toh
waqt chalta hai
waqt ka magar rang utarta hai akira
udte udte phir ek lamha maine pakad liya re

jiya jiya re jiya re
jiya jiya re jiya re
jiya jiya re jiya re jiya oh ho

jiya jiya re jiya re
jiya jiya re jiya re
jiya jiya re jiya re jiya oh ho

make the way for 
halke halke pardo mein
muskurana achha lagta hai
roshni jo deta ho toh
dil jalana achha lagta hai
ek pal sahi umr bhar isey sath rakhna akira
zindagi se phir ek waada maine kar liya re

jiya jiya re jiya re
jiya jiya re jiya re
jiya jiya re jiya re jiya oh ho

jiya jiya re jiya re
jiya jiya re jiya re
jiya jiya re jiya re jiya oh ho
chali re chali re junoon ko liye
pinjre se uda dil ka shikra
khudi se maine ishq kiya re
jiya jiya re jiya re
jiya jiya re jiya re
jiya jiya re jiya re jiya oh ho
jiya jiya re jiya re
jiya jiya re jiya re
jiya jiya re jiya re jiya oh ho
