 kehta hai pal pal tumse
hoke dil yeh deewana

mujhse door nahi jaana

aankhon mein meri
tera hi chehra dhadakta rahe
haan tu jo naa mile
seene mein dil ye tadapta rahe

aankhon mein meri
tera hi chehra dhadakta rahe
tu jo naa mile
seene mein dil ye tadapta rahe

tu mujhe na satana
mera dil na dukhana

pyaar kiya to nibhaba

main jahaan rahun
tere hi paas woh jagah hai kahin
matlab jeene ka
teri hi saanson mein chupa hai kahin

main jahaan rahun
tere hi paas woh jagah hai kahin
matlab jeene ka
teri hi saanson mein chupa hai kahin

saara chhod ke zamaana
