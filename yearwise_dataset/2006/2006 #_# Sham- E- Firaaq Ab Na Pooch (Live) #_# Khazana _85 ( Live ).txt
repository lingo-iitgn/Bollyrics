 shaamefiraaq ab na pooch aayi aur aa ke tal gayi
dil tha ke phir bahal gaya jaan thi ke phir sambhal gayi

ask not of the night of separation it came and it passed away
my heart found a way to please itself again life found a way to get back on track again

bazmekhayaal mein tere husn ki shama jal gayi
dard ka chaand bujh gaya hijr ki raat dhal gayi

in the gathering mehfil of my thoughts the candle of your beauty was lit
the moonlight of pain died down the night of separation slipped away

jab tujhe yaad kar liya subah mehak mehak uthi
jab tera gham jaga liya raat machal machal gayi

whenever you were remembered the mornings became fragrant
when your pain was awakened the nights grew restless

dil se to har muamkar ke chale they saaf hum
kehne mein unke saamne baat badal badal gayi

in my heart i had sorted all the issues before setting out
but when speaking before her my words changed themselves

aakhireshab ke humsafar faiz na jaane kya huey
reh gayi kis jagah sabaa subah kidhar nikal gayi

what happened of the fellowtravelers at the endofthenight faiz
at what crossroad did the breeze get left behind and when did dawn disappear
