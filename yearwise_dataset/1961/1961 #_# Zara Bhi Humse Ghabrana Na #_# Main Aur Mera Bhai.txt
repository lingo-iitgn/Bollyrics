 what you doing with him
he aint calling out your name not tonight
cos hes the cheating type yeah
girl youre just getting played
accept the blame and walk away let me make this easy
cos i know that i could treat you right
ive been thinking about you day and night
just realize im not like them other guys

cos you and me we could have been forever
my love will live on and on and on
dont walk away from me
he doesnt feel the same
ill give you what you need

what you doing to me
ive been talking to your answer phone
youre not alone  are you with him
youre taken in by every little thing he says
when i could give you everything
i know that youre the trusting type
but you cant believe all his alibis
just realize  im not just another guy

i was waiting my whole life for this moment
i was waiting my whole life for this moment
but you threw it all away

cos you and me we could have been forever
my love will live on and on and on
dont walk away from me
he doesnt feel the same
ill give you what you need
