 maasuum chehara nigaahen farebi
an innocent face deceitful glances

labon pe hansi aur dil men daga hai
laughter on the lips and treachery in the heart

maasuum chehara nigaahen farebi
labon pe hansi aur dil men daga hai
mile dost jisko yahaan tere jaisa
he who has a friend like you

use dushmanon ki zaruurat hai kya hai
what need has he for enemies

maasuum chehara nigaahen farebi
labon pe hansi aur dil men daga hai
dil tor diya kyon itna bataa de
just tell me why you broke my heart

phir baad men bevafaa jo chaahe mujhko sazaa de
then later punish me with whatever act of faithlessness you like

dil tor diya kyon itna bataa de
phir baad men bevafaa jo chaahe mujhko sazaa de
teri beruukhi se pareshaan huun main
im distressed by your enmity

na aaye samajh men yeh kya maajara hai
i dont understand whats happening here

maasuum chehara nigaahen farebi
labon pe hansi aur dil men daga hai

jo bharta nahin woh zakhm diya hai

the wound that has been given does not heal
mujhko nahin pyaar ko badnaam tuu ne kiya hai

you didnt give me a bad name you gave one to love
jise main ne puuja masiha banaake

the one i made my messiah and worshipped
na tha yeh pataa pattharon ka banaa hai
i didnt know he was made of stone
maasuum chehara nigaahen farebi
labon pe hansi aur dil men daga hai
mile dost jisko yahaan tere jaisa
he who has a friend like you
use dushmanon ki zaruurat hai kya hai
what need has he for enemies
maasuum chehara nigaahen farebi
labon pe hansi aur dil men daga hai
