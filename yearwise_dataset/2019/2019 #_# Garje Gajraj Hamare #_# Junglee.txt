inko na tum chhedo bhaiya
dude dont mess with them
sanak na jaye inka pahiya
may their temper not get vexed
are inko na tum chhedo bhaiya
dude dont mess with him
sanak na jaye inka pahiya
may their temper not get vexed

yeh waise to cool hain
they are usually very cool
par inka ek usool hai
but they live by a principle
ye bhoolte na bhai kuch bhi
they dont forget a single thing
inse panga lena bhool hai
its a grave mistake to mess with them

yeh baith bhi jayein
even when they sit down
to hote hain sher se upar
theyre still taller than lion
ye tata thaiya karte
they dance
bade mast mozi banker
in a cool funky way
bhage sare paun pasare
everybody runs away with their life
garje jab gajraj hamare
when our mighty elephant roars in anger

dhum dhum dhum an imitating loud sound of elephant steps
dhum dhum kape dhara dhara
the earth is shaking
ye panja rakhein bhare bhare ye
they have loaded ammunitions
mrignayani aankhon mein basja
either try to be in their good book
ya phir unke raste se hat ja
or stay from their ways

pyar se bolo
if you adore them
goud uthale
theyd keep you in their head
akh dikhai
if you try to scare them
toh dhobi pachhade
then theyd bang you hard

hoye hoye hoye hoye hoye hoye

inka jungle hai tashan
they are passionate about their forest
khud mein rehte hain magan
theyre indulged in their own affairs
sher khan bhi kare hain
even the mighty tigers
inke samne jatan
try to behave well in front of them

milkar dharti ambar sare
the ground and the sky together
karte shaath shhat naman tumhare
saluting you o mighty elephant
