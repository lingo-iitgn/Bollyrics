ramta jogi behta maa ki kahe kahaani
maa ka naam sadaa rehta baaki sab kuch paani

maa hi mandir maa hi 
maa hi mandir maa hi puja

maa se badhke koi na dooja
maa hi mandir maa hi maa se badhke koi na duja
maa hi mandir 
aaa aaaa

maa ke punya se jagat bana ishwar ko bhi maa ne chuna maa mamta ka ek kalash hai jeevan jyot hai amrit ras 
kya ambar aur kya ye maa ki tulna ho nahi sakti
maa ki gaatha dohraate hain they all repeat the stories of mother
bade bade gyani kahte hain
highly learnedwise men say
maa ka rutba sabse ooncha
the stature of mother is the highest

maa hi mandir maa hi puja
mother is temple mother is worship
maa se badhke koi na duja
theres no one holier than mother
maa hi mandir
mother is temple

aaa aaaa

mitti ho gayi maa ki kaya
the body of mother has become dust
bhatak raha hai phir bhi saaya
but her soul is still roaming around
kadi dhoop mein soch rahi hai
in strong sunlight she is thinking that
laal pe apne kar doon chhaaya
how to cast a shadow on her lovely son

shool bani hai maa ki vivashta
the compulsion of mother has become her spear
vyakul hai soojhe na rasta
she is perplexed she doesnt know the solution
shool bani hai maa ki vivashta
the compulsion of mother has become her spear
vyakul hai soojhe na rasta she is perplexed she doesnt know the solution
saral bahut hai kehna sun na
it is very easy to speak and listen
kathin bada hi hai maa ban na
but it is very difficult to become a mother

maa hi mandir maa hi puja
mother is temple mother is worship
maa se badhke koi na duja
theres no one holier than mother
maa hi mandir
mother is temple

janam janam ki maa dukhiyaari
mother is sad since so many decades
karke har koshish ye haari
she is sitting lost after trying everything
bhai baawri ulajh gayi hai
she has gone crazy she is totally confused
bachhe ka sukh dhoond rahi hai
she is searching for the happiness of her child
bhookh se munna tadap raha hai
her son is suffering with hunger
mann ka dheeraj toot gaya hai
the patience of her mind has been broken
aanchal mein hai doodh ki nadiyaan
in her abode there are rivers of milk
aur anhkhon mein neer bhara hai but her eyes are full of tears
sabko sahara dene waali
o the one who supports everyoneo mother
kaun bane ab tere sahara who will support you now
