 ishq binaa kyaa maranaa yaaro ishq binaa kyaa jiinaa
what is dieing without being in love what is living without being in love

gud se miithaa ishqishq
the love is more sweet than dries up sugarcane juice

imalii se khattaa ishq
the love is more sour than tamarind

vaadaa ye pakkaa ishqishq
this love is a strong commitment

dhaagaa ye kachchaa ishq
this love is a raw thread

ishq binaa kyaa jiinaa yaaro ishq binaa kyaa maranaa yaaro
what is living without being in love what is dieing without being in love

niiche ishq hai uupar rab hai in donon ke biich men sab hai
underneath is love overhead is god everything lies in between the two

ek nahiin sab baaten kar lo sau baaton kaa ek matalab hai
not one but do every talk there is only one meaning of hundreds of talks

rab sabase sonaa ishqishq
god is better than everybody

rab se bhii sonaa ishq
love is better than god

hiiraa naa pannaa ishqishq
neither diamond nor emerald just love love

ishq bina kya jeena yaron lyrics on bas ek tamannaa ishqishq
just one desire love love

ishq hai kyaa ye kisako pataa ye ishq hai kyaa sabako pataa
what is love this is known to whom what is this love everybody knows

ye premnagar anjaan dagar saajan kaa ghar kyaa kisako kabar
this city of love unknown pathways the home of the lover who knows

chhotii sii umar ye lambaa safar ye ishq hai kyaa ye kisako pataa
the little age this is a long journey what is this love who knows

ye dard hai yaa dardon kii davaa ye koii sanam yaa aap kudaa
is this pain or the cure of all pains is this some love or it itself is god

tum ne ishq kaa naam sunaa hai ham ne ishq kiyaa hai
you have heard the name of love i have been in love

phuulon kaa gulashan ishqishq
the garden of flower love love

kaanton kaa daaman ishq
the scarf full og thorns love love

ishqishq ishqishq ishqishq ishqishq

kisii ke ishq ke vaade kahiin ham tod aaye the promises made in someones love i have left broken somewhere

magar ye dil ye jaan shaayad vahiin ham chhod aaye but this heart this life probably i have left there itself

ishq binaa ishq binaa
ishq binaa kyaa jiinaa yaaraa ishq binaa kyaa maranaa 
ishqishq ishqishq

gud se miithaa
imalii se khattaa
vaadaa ye pakkaa
dhaagaa ye kachchaa ishq

gud se miithaa ishq
imalii se khattaa ishq
vaadaa ye pakkaa ishq
dhaagaa ye kachchaa ishq

is se pahale is raste men kitane hii mahabuub gaye before this on this path so many beloved ones have passed thorugh

raste men dariyaa hai koii
raste men dariyaa hai koii jis men saare duub gaye there is some ocean on the way in which all of them have got drowned

phal sab se sachchaa
this is the true result of all

har jhuuth se jhuuthaa
it is more false than every falsehood

vaadaa ye pakkaa
dhaagaa ye kachchaa

ishq binaa main ishq binaa ishq binaa ishq binaa
ishq binaa kyaa jiinaa yaaro ishq binaa kyaa maranaa yaaro

ishq binaa ishq binaa ishq binaa ishq binaa
ishq binaa kyaa jiinaa yaaro ishq binaa kyaa maranaa yaaro
