 when the night has come
when the night has come and the land is dark
when the night has come
when the night has come and the land is dark
and the moon is the only light
and the moon is the only light
and the moon is the only light we will see
so darlin darlin
o mehrma mere mehrma
o poori hai duaa
abb kuch bhi toh kam nahi
tujhe paa ke lage mukammal hai khuda
o rehnuma o mere rehnuma
o oo tere naam saa ab koi bhi lafz nahi
padhkar dekhe sau kitabe sau dafaa

dildara dildara ye ratti bhar ka jag saara
dildara dildaara tere nazar o karam pe sab waara
dildara dildara jag jeeta jab tujhse haara

dildara dildara
darling darling stand by me
comn stand by me
stand by me
darling darling stand by me
comn stand by me
stand by me

sa ni sa
when the night has come and the land is dark
and moon is th only light
when the night has come and the land is dark

darlin darlin
o rehmana o mere rehmana o o tujhse waasta and the moon is the only light
tu manzil hai aur tu hi uss manzil ke aagee ka rasta when the land is dark

dildara dildara ye ratti bhar ka jag saara
dildara dildaara tere nazar o karam pe sab waara
dildara dildara jag jeeta jab tujhse haara
dildara dildara
darlin darlin stand by me
