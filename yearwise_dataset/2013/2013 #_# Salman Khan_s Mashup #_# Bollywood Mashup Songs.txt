 kahin pyaar na ho jaaye  
dont let me fall in love

pyaar na ho jaaye
dont let me fall in love

ae dil bataa yeh tujhe kya hua
oh heart tell me what has happened to you

tu hai kyoon beqaraar itnaa  
why are you so restless

kahin pyaar na ho jaaye  
dont let me fall in love

ae dil bataa yeh tujhe kya hua
oh heart tell me what has happened to you

tu hai kyoon beqaraar itnaa  
why are you so restless

kahin pyaar na ho jaaye  
dont let me fall in love

jee chaahe jee bhar ke chaahoon usse main
my desire is desire you with all my heart

chaahat ka mausam na beete kabhi
dont let the season of desire ever pass by

uske khayaalon mein khoya rahoon main
let me stay lost in her thoughts

manzil mujhe to milegi vahi
i will obtain my destination there

yeh hai aitbaar dil ki pukar sun mere yaar ho
this is trust the call of the heart listen my beloved

kahin pyaar na ho jaaye  
dont let me fall in love

kahin pyaar na ho jaaye  
dont let me fall in love

ae dil bataa yeh tujhe kya hua
oh heart tell me what has happened to you

tu hai kyoon beqaraar itnaa
why are you so restless

sapnon mein jo mere aane lagaa hai
who is coming into my dreams

apna voh lagne lagaa hai mujhe
he is becoming one of my own

harpal jo aankhon mein rehne lagaa hai
who is staying always in front of my eyes

pyaara voh lagne lagaa hai mujhe
he is becoming very sweet to me

mujhe baar baar hai intezaar kab aaye yaar ho
i am waiting every moment when will my beloved come

kahin pyaar na ho jaaye  
dont let me fall in love

kahin pyaar na ho jaaye  
dont let me fall in love

ae dil bataa yeh tujhe kya hua
oh heart tell me what has happened to you

tu hai kyoon beqaraar itnaa
why are you so restless

kahin pyaar na ho jaaye  
dont let me fall in love

kahin pyaar na ho jaaye  
dont let me fall in love
