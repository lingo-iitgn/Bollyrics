 bheege pade joote kahin
its you and me
dabba khucoffee nahi
its you and me

chhata kabhi khulta nahin
its you and me
khidki rahe hardum khuli
its you and me

tedhi yeh zindagi
jaisi yeh dosti
hai galat sab yahan
par sabhi hai sahi

shopping kari taxi nahi
its you and me
walking kari sandal gayi
its you and me

traffic kabhi chalti nahi
its you and me
bas toh koi jaldi nahin
its you you and me

woh raste tedhe medhe raste
jab bhi ho jaaye kabhi yahan
dal dal lage jahan

hasle baahon ko phaike
thodi pi jaaye khuli hawa
free mein milli hawa

behte khalasi hai
bhatke jahansi hai
udne ko raazi hai
mod de hum fiza

thode deewane hain
thode sayaane hain
paapi puraane hain
choos le hum maza oh oo

chalte huye phisle kahin
its you and me
haste huye nikle kahin
its you and me

jamte hue pighle kahin
its you and me
bante hue bikhre kahin
its you and me

tedhi yeh zindagi
jaisi yeh dosti
hai galat sab yahan
per sabhi hai sahi
