 aaaaah aa yahan zara kabhi bhool ja ghar ka raasta
aur abhi jeena shuru kar jo yeh din na aayega
aa abhi abhi tere bin jiya ab na jaayega
dekh phir duniya ko hum ungli pe kaisa nachaayega
dil chaahe hey aaye hey
kabhi tu baahon mein meri
mil jaaye ay haaye ay
duniya chaahe yeh jal jaaye
dekh udoon main udoon in hawaaon mein
tu jo mile tho mile ecstasy
dekh udoon main udoon in hawaaon mein
tu jo mile tho mile ecstasy
round round spin it round
drop it down cuz its only dawn
down down bring it down
let me see that booty on the ground
ready or not i bring through your stereos hot
back by popular demand the hysterias up
about time to give entertainment a facelift
the genghis of rap invading your playlists
looking uber cool in that fly apparel
make a kudi go ooh what a feisty mammal
liven it up see me jumping out your jukebox
hit you with that breeze of awesomeness through your woofer
as you watch me fling open the door and slide through
the mere glimpse of me for sure excites you
keep the ground vibrating the dust stuck in the air
embrace the opulent vibe engulfing the lair
and dirty talking through rhymes these girls get blown away
as i give them the intense urge to fornicate
now give me the microphone and look at me spitting a cyclone
while im chilling and willing to give it to women whore spending a night alone
by the bar doing them shots of whiskey
and their bras mandatorily drop like milk teeth
tonight these ladies wanna get wild with brodha v
the aphrodiety with high fertility go
round round spin it round
drop it down cuz its only dawn
down down bring it down
let me see that booty on the ground
dirty beat bajaaye haaye
floor hilaathi jaaye
neend mori udjaaye neend mori udjaaye
dirty beat bajaaye
hands up fellas put your hands up ay
get wild everybody put your hands up oh
hands up ladies put your hands up ay

round round spin it round
drop it down cuz its only dawn
down down bring it down
let me see that booty on the ground
dekh udoon main udoon in hawaaon mein
tu jo mile tho mile ecstasy
