 yeahranveer singhjack and jones homescheck it
live every day like its my aakhri or pehla
na hoon fukra na hoon vella
tere nehle pe hoon dehla
beta main hoon tera guru aur tu hai mera chela
that ranveer guys so crazy
haan main hoon saahatela
im a freak in this carnival
instincts of an animal
ruthless like a cannibal
foolish and hungry
all and sundry
be warned
ab batao king kaun its on im king kong

a storm is coming
from back in the day my rhymes they be wack
but i spit em anyway cause i dont hold from back in the day my clothes they be wack
but i wear em anyway cause i dont hold maine maari entry crowd goes bonkers
i come see conquer
dance floor stomper
nuclear bomber
all night romper
so loud i could bust the amp
enroll in my swagger camp
cant stop wont stop cherry pop
raise your fist in the air for the peoples 
break

im the firestarter
twisted firestarter
and i fight harder
i dont hold backtoh chalo kadam badhao
aur haath uthao
jigra toh dikhao
from back in the day my rhymes they be wack
but i spit em anyway cause i dont hold from back in the day my clothes they be wack
but i wear em anyway cause i dont hold from back in the day my rhymes they be wack
but i spit em anyway cause i dont hold from back in the day my clothes they be wack
but i wear em anyway cause i dont hold and now its my day and i might be wack
but im killin this cause i dont hold 
peace
