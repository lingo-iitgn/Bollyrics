 chal chal chal ab uth bhi jaa
nas nas me tu josh jaga
kuch bhi nahi aasan yahan
apni raahein khud hi bana

mehnat kar paseena bahaa
rukna aur thakna hai mana
jeetna chahe agar tu yahan
kar khudko taiyar zara

get ready to fight
get ready to fight
get ready to fight
get ready to fight
get ready to fight

tough tough tough hai life yahan
usse bhi tough tu banke dikha
pal pal aage badta hi jaa
khudko manzil tak pahucha

aaj ke aage kal ko jhuka
soch na tu ab karke dikha
jeetna chahe agar tu yahan
kar khudko taiyar zara

get ready to fight
get ready to fight
get ready to fight
get ready to fight
get ready to fight

were going in like
there is nothing to loose
nothing to prove
its all about positive attitude

get down again
backoff again
cmon shake up that
life is too short

zor laga tu jaan laga
apni alag pehchaan bana
jeetna chahe agar tu yahan
kar khudko taiyar zara

get ready to fight
get ready to fight
get ready to fight
get ready to fight
get ready to fight
