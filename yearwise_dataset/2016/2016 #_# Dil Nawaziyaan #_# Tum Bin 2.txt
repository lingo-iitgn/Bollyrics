 chaand ko fitoor hai
uske paas noor hai
aap se minahin
tabhi toh ye guroor hai

dil mein koi chor hai
ya aashiqui ka zor hai
aisi tareef ki wajah koi zaroor hai

ye dil nawaziyaan
ho ye dil nawaziyaan

aaj balamwa ghar more aaye
mann more itraaye haaye
jhalak mili jo baanke piya ki
nain phire bohraaye haaye
nain phire bohraaye haaye

you follow me  like
falling drops of rain
you hold me close and tell me
we wont be apart again
you needed to be found
now when you look around
you find me there right next to you
forever till the end

you follow me  like
falling drops of rain
you hold me close and tell me
we wont be apart again
you needed to be found
now when you look around
you find me there right next to you
forever till the end

yeh dil nawaziyaan
ho yeh dil nawaziyaan
yeh dil nawaziyaan
o yeh dil nawaziyaan
