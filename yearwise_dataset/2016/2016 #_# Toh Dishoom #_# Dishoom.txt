 i remember those days
of my childhood
father used to say hes hopeless
cant hope from him for anything
mommy used to feed me
rice amp curd with immense love
no  star hotel can compare to moms food
none

got a degree
jobs a tragedy salarys a joke
got a girlfriend
she too dumped me
still waiting to get dumped again
but first need a girl for a girlfriend

imma direct gods child
just like you
if someone does something wrong
i dont sit back amp relax

someone molesting a girl
then dishoom
if someone cheats
then dishoom
someone says ill about my india
then dishoom
didnt stand up during national anthemn
then dishoom
then dishoom dishoom

i like listening to kishore kumar in bathroom
but also like to keep a photo of ketty perry
i have got babes in bikini hanging around me
but life is not like a music video

doesnt matter during the day how heroic i have been
but like to hug my pillow amp sleep
if sometime i had much in a party
then i cry remembering the good ol days

imma a direct son of god
just like you
if i spread my hands


if someone starts religious riots
then dishoom
if someone scares a young child
then dishoom
if someone is addicted to drugs
then dishoom
if someone troubles my bros
then dishoom

then dishoom dishoom
then dishoom dishoom
















imma direct gods child
just like you
if someone does something wrong
i dont sit back amp relax


then dishoom

then dishoom

then dishoom

then dishoom

then dishoom

then dishoom

then dishoom

then dishoom

then dishoom
