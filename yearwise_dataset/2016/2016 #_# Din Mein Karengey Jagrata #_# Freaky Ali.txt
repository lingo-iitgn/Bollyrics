 udta udta more meri gali vich aa gaya
lagta tha anaadi par dance sikha gaya

a flying peacock came to my i thought of it as useless but it taught me how to 
o loud speaker loud baja ke
de do sabko warning
oye dance nahi rukega
chaahe ho javangi morning

play the loud speaker loudly
and warn everybody
that the dance wont stop today
even if it gets 
dhol kahin jab bajta hai to
humse ruka nahi jaata
nachne de siva kuch nai aata
ho aaj din mein karenge jagraata
ho nachne de siva kuch nahi aata
ajj din mein karenge jagrata 
when the dhol plays somewhere
we cant we know nothing except dance
well have an allnighter in the day 
jagraata literally waking all night is generally an allnight worship most commonly worshipping goddess durga

are aaj kisi chhote vadde ki
baat na maanenge
are out of control hoke
kamar hilenge

today well not listen to
anyone young or well be out of control
and move our 
to naacho de dhana dhan
karenge too much fun
music bhi loud bajega
rhythm bhi tan tana tan

so dance like anything
well have too much music will be loud
rhythm will be fun 
oye dhol kahin bajta hai to
humse ruka nahi jaata
nachne de siva kuch nai aata
ho aaj din mein karenge jagrata
