 teri baarishein bhigaaye mujhe
you let me out of this prison

i was lost i was brokenup
should be let me listen
even when im wrong
look what you have done
so hard to know
how you light up my world
made you  took my time to be sure
i been look what you have done
so hard to say
why should love me like you love no other
cause you and me baby
baby were a team teri baarishein bhigaaye mujhe
yahi toh pyar hai
ae mere dil mubarak ho
yahi toh pyar hai
wo im in llllove with you
wo im in llllove with you
wo im in llllove with you
wo im in llllove
aisa lagta hai kyun
teri aankhen jaise
aankhon mein meri reh gayi
kabhi pehle maine na suni jo
aisi baatein keh gayi
look what youve done
so hard to know
how you light up my world
made you  took my time to be sure
i been look what you have done
so hard to say
why should love me like you love no other
cause you and me baby
baby were a team ae mere dil mubarak ho
yahi toh pyar hai
