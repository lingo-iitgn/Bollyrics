 zara aankhon mein kajal laga lo sanam put some kohl in your eyes my beloved
surkh chehre pe zulfein gira lo sanam
on this ruby face of yours drop some of your rich hair zara aankhon mein kajal laga lo sanam put some kohl in your eyes my beloved
surkh chehre pe zulfein gira lo sanam
on this ruby face of yours drop some of your rich hair tere galoon pe jo kaatil hai the mole which is there on your cheeks
wohi meri dil hai that is my heart
teri baaton ne aisa kiya hai assar your talks have made such an impact on me
sharm se jhuk rahi hai meri ye nazar my eyes are looking down in shyness
teri baaton ne aisa kiya hai assar your talks have made such an impact on me
sharm se jhuk rahi hai meri ye nazar my eyes are looking down in shyness
tujhe jisne deewana kiya hai the one that has made you crazy meri bindiya hai is my bindi a decorative dot put on the centre of forehead
kaali si aankhein aankhon mein kajal your black eyes and in those eyes there is kohl
kyoon na ho ghayal dil mera why wouldnt my heart faint
o chodo ji chodo baatein banaana oh
leave it dont make such talks
pagal hai pagal dil tera your heart is mad
dhak dhak kyoon karta hai why does it beat so hard
mujhpe ye marta hai it is dying on me
dard jisne tujhe ye diya hai
the one that has given you so much pain meri bindiya hai is my bindi
zara aankhon mein kajal laga lo sanam put some kohl in your eyes my beloved
surkh chehre pe zulfein gira lo sanam
on this ruby face of yours drop some of your rich hair tere galoon pe jo kaatil hai the mole which is there on your cheeks
wohi meri dil hai that is my heart
laali ye laali hoton ki laali
this redness this redness of your lips aaja chura loon chori se let me steal it secretively
o tu jo bulaye main bhaagi aaon oh
when you call me i come running kheeche tu aisi dori se you are pulling me with such a string
khud pe na kaabu hai i dont have control over myself
chaahat ka jaadu hai it is the magic because of love
chain jisne tera le liya hai the one that has taken away your rest
meri bindiya hai is my bindi
zara aankhon mein kajal laga lo sanam put some kohl in your eyes my beloved
surkh chehre pe zulfein gira lo sanam
on this ruby face of yours drop some of your rich hair tere galoon pe jo kaatil hai the mole which is there on your cheeks
wohi meri dil hai that is my heart
teri baaton ne aisa kiya hai assar your talks have made such an impact on me
sharm se jhuk rahi hai meri ye nazar my eyes are looking down in shyness
tujhe jisne deewana kiya hai the one that has made you crazy meri bindiya hai is my bind
